          <p class="timeline-description">
            Moxie robot owners faced a frustrating limitation: changing appearances and personalities
            required navigating through the official app, waiting for content updates, and dealing with
            subscription barriers. Parents wanted more control over their $800+ investment.

          <p class="timeline-description">
            Through reverse engineering and network analysis, we discovered Moxie communicates via MQTT
            and HTTP APIs. The robot's configuration is stored in simple JSON files, making it possible
            to create direct control interfaces without cloud dependencies.

            Open Moxie 2.0 was born - a native macOS application providing instant access to all
            70+ features, 55 appearance options, and 11 personalities. Built with zero dependencies,
            1,723 lines of carefully crafted code, and a plastic toy aesthetic that matches Moxie's playful nature.
