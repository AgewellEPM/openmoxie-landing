        OpenMoxie was powerful — but you needed terminal skills to use it. Open Moxie 2.0 changes that.

          <p class="timeline-description">
            The OpenMoxie backend was already running — a powerful Django server that gave complete control
            over Moxie robots via MQTT and HTTP APIs. But there was a problem: you had to use terminal commands,
            Docker containers, and command-line tools to access it.

          <p class="timeline-description">
            Parents wanted to customize their Moxie robots, but they shouldn't need to know how to run
            <code>mosquitto_pub</code> commands or navigate Docker containers. The power was there,
            but locked behind a technical wall.
